# Statistical-Learning
Repo for ANLY 512 (Statistical Learning)

Most of these just demonstrate competency and understanding of common machine learning algorithms.

Homework 1 is really a brush-up on basic statistical methods.

Homework 2 deals with fitting very simple linear models to built-in data.

Homework 3 works with interaction terms in linear models.

Homework 4 looks at GLMs - specifically logistic regression. It also tests ROC curves, confusion matrices, and other metrics for scoring categorical categorization.

Homework 5 is an intro to Neural Nets.

Homeworks 6 and 7 are feature selection - Stepwise, LASSO, Ridge, Elastic Net, etc. Also polynomial regression and variable transformations.

Homeworks 8 and 9 are tree-based methods (Random Forest, Bagging, GBMs).

Homework 10 explores SVMs with all kinds of kernels.

The Final asks more challenging, theoretical concepts about the topics above.
